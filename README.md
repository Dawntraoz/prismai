## Built-in Prompt API for Chrome Extensions

> The Prompt API is an exploratory API, which means it's primarily intended for prototyping. We're asking for feedback to confirm assumptions and determine what task APIs we build in the future. As such, exploratory APIs may never launch.

1. Register the Web Extension at: [https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/320318523496726529](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/320318523496726529) with origin [chrome-extension://fekikbgcgaphconkdmeicdpddgjhcgdb](chrome-extension://fekikbgcgaphconkdmeicdpddgjhcgdb)
2. Get the Token and copy it at .env `PROMPT_API_TOKEN`
3. Follow the steps on [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/ai/prompt-api](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/ai/prompt-api) to get started with this API
